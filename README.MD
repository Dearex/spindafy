How to use:
- Download the zip
- Edit the settings in to_spinda.py if you want (default should be fine for use)
- If you didn't change the default filenames place a "test.mp4" in the res folder
- Run the to_spinda.py (will take a while)
- Watch your video in spinda! Video will be saved as "test_output.mp4" in res
